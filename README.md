8. Factorial of a Number: 

You are going to write an application to determine the factorial of a single number.

A factorial of an integer is the product of that integer and all the integers below it. For example, the factorial of 4 is (4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24).

The user will be required to enter an integer.

You will then calculate the factorial of that integer and print the result to the screen.
